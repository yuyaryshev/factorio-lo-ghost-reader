  "description": "Adds radio equipment that can create any number of wireless networks. Multiple wireless networks are supported. All signal types are supported. Usage is very simple: place a transmitter and a receiver, both should have same channel to be connected. If many transmitters share same channel - you get summ of all. Very fast implementation - no range calculations allowed to optimize all the code. You can copy channel settings for all devices in standard way (Shift+RClick - copy, Shift+LClick - paste).",
