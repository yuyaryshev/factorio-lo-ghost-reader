LordOdin's Radio Telemetry version 1.0.0
Author: LordOdin (http://github.com/LordOdin)

A Factorio mod which transmits signals (telemetry) over long distances.

Adds radio equipment that can create any number of wireless networks. Multiple wireless networks are supported. 
All signal types are supported. 
Usage is very simple: place a transmitter and a receiver, both should have same channel to be connected. 
If many transmitters share same channel - you get summ of all on each receiver. 

Very fast implementation - no range calculations allowed to optimize all the code.
